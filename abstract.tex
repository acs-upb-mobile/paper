\textit{The university is a complex environment with many creative people having as a disadvantage the fact that it sometimes develops chaotically. This development is visible in the vast array of software applications meant to assist students. Over time in our university, many such platforms were developed, including the university website, the faculty website, websites of different student organizations, wikis created by professors or departments, and the official course platform. This variety turned into an information overload for students who are expected to be aware of everything that is posted on these websites, to discern between relevant information and spam, while also busy attending courses and completing assignments.}

\textit{We believe that students themselves can address this issue by using the power of the community to flag and organize important information from these websites, disseminate it to relevant colleagues and help each other get through the labyrinth of information existing in the university.}

\textit{With this goal in mind, this paper describes a collaborative app that allows students to better organize their time and schedule by collectively identifying the most useful information from the university's sources and intelligently sharing it with their peers.}
