\textit{One of the early challenges that most students have to face is campus navigation. In a university with multiple buildings spread out around the city, each hosting tens of different classrooms and endless corridors, figuring out when your next class is supposed to start can be rather difficult. While tools like Google Maps can be useful in navigating between some of the campus buildings, they stop helping once you need to navigate inside the buildings.}

\textit{This paper proposes an interactive campus map of \acrlong{upb} (\acrshort{upb}) which offers indoor and outdoor navigation support, while being integrated with existing timetable and schedule management systems.}
