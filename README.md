| [Design and implementation of a cross-platform mobile application that facilitates student collaboration](Design%20and%20implementation%20of%20a%20cross-platform%20mobile%20application%20that%20facilitates%20student%20collaboration) | [Ioana Alexandru](https://github.com/IoanaAlexandru) | _June 2020_ | The university is a complex environment with many creative people having as a disadvantage the fact that it sometimes develops chaotically. This development is visible in the vast array of software applications meant to assist students. Over time in our university, many such platforms were developed, including the university website, the faculty website, websites of different student organizations, wikis created by professors or departments, and the official course platform. This variety turned into an information overload for students who are expected to be aware of everything that is posted on these websites, to discern between relevant information and spam, while also busy attending courses and completing assignments. <br/>We believe that students themselves can address this issue by using the power of the community to flag and organize important information from these websites, disseminate it to relevant colleagues and help each other get through the labyrinth of information existing in the university. <br/>With this goal in mind, this paper describes a collaborative app that allows students to better organize their time and schedule by collectively identifying the most useful information from the university’s sources and intelligently sharing it with their peers. |
| [Encouraging actionable feedback from students through a mobile application](Encouraging%20actionable%20feedback%20from%20students%20through%20a%20mobile%20application) | [Andrei-Constantin Mirciu](https://github.com/andreicmirciu) | _July 2021_ | The act of sharing feedback lies in the character of each human. In the absence of constructive opinions from others, the likelihood of people developing their abilities and evolving their careers decreases dramatically. <br/>Universities often offer opportunities to their students to share their impressions on different topics.  However, students are often reluctant or too little encouraged. In addition, the reviews passed between different generations of students are entirely disorganized. Hence, this thesis explores the reasons that usually prompt students to be disinterested in the action of providing feedback and dives into understanding their level of appreciation on the usefulness of it. Moreover, we contribute to decreasing the overall chaos generated by all the opinions distributed via social media platforms or randomly unofficial questionnaires by creating a comprehensive environment. <br/>We analyze the existing situation of feedback in the educational environment and investigate the needs of students. Based on the ideas collected, we propose a mobile application solution that uses production-ready systems and tools for offering stability and scalability. It contains various modules designed to broaden the awareness of what constructive feedback means and provide ease of use, transparency, and a structured data set. |
| [University schedule personalization and automatization for productivity](University%20schedule%20personalization%20and%20automatization%20for%20productivity) | [Bogdan Iuga](https://github.com/iugabogdan98) | _July 2021_ | This paper presents the implementation and integration of a module dedicated to improving the way of handling university activities inside an already existing application. <br/>The main functionalities implemented were the addition of separated events for university tasks such as homework and projects, the possibility of choosing goals for them, and the creation of visual elements in order to help the user find relevant information faster. <br/>The application being already used by the students of the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, there were analyzed the administrative structures inside the faculty and also other applications that have the same functionalities like the ones proposed in this paper, in order to satisfy the needs of the students. <br/>The theme was analyzed from different points of view, such as the used architecture. the user interface, the technologies used. <br/>The development conventions of the application were followed so the result works alongside the other modules and can be delivered to the users. |
| [Conversational agent in romanian for ACS-UPB mobile application](Conversational%20agent%20in%20romanian%20for%20ACS-UPB%20mobile%20application) | [Gabriel Gavriluță](https://github.com/gabrielGavriluta) | _July 2021_ | The university environment creates many questions in the minds of students. Since enrolling in a university, they face a number of questions, related to accommodation on student campuses, tuition fees or other things they need to prepare for the start of the academic year. <br/>During the years of study, there will certainly be more doubts that need to be answered, regarding the administrative part of the faculty or the courses they take. Thus, in order to facilitate the search for information, this paper describes the implementation of a conversational agent who can answer these questions through the ACS-UPB Mobile application. |
| [Indoor and Outdoor Campus Navigation](Indoor%20and%20Outdoor%20Campus%20Navigation) | [Ioana Alexandru](https://github.com/IoanaAlexandru) | _July 2022_ | One of the early challenges that most students have to face is campus navigation. In a university with multiple buildings spread out around the city, each hosting tens of different classrooms and endless corridors, figuring out when your next class is supposed to start can be rather difficult. While tools like Google Maps can be useful in navigating between some of the campus buildings, they stop helping once you need to navigate inside the buildings. This paper proposes an interactive campus map of University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest (UPB) which offers indoor and outdoor navigation support, while being integrated with existing timetable and schedule management systems.|
